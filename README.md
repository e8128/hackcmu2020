# HACKCMU 2020: CMU Schedule Optimizer

Want to register for a schedule where have you to wake up the latest? Want to take as many in-person classes as you can?

Given a list of your courses and a metric, the CMU Schedule Optimizer generates all possible schedules using data extracted from the Course Catalog in order to find the best one that best fits your needs. It also displays helpful statistics and information so you can best understand your schedule and plan your academic journey around it. 

There are multiple options to choose from, including options that promote physical health like our 'Cardio' option! Or if you absolutely need downtime between classes, 
our tool can do that too, finding the best sections to maximize your downtime between classes.
